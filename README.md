----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An app for planning a beach day. Made with Python and Streamlit. This app allows you to enter a ZIP code and skin type to show you nearby beaches, the current UV, and how you should prepare based on your sensitivity to UV. There is a timer built in to let you know when you should get out of the sun. To help, a page lets you select your skin color, hair color, and eye color to tell you what skin type you have.


We based the recommendations for sunlight exposure on the following scientific paper from the *"National Library of Medicine"*: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321117/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321117/)
